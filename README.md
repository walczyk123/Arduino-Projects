# Arduino-Projects
This small repository, contains a few arduino projects, such as arduino sender and receiver (uart) and temperature reading (ds18b20)  

ardiuno_sender_ds18b20_sens -> reading data from multiple ds18b20 sensors and sending them via UART  
arduino_reciver_7-seg_disp -> receiving data from another arduino via UART and display them on 7-segment, 4-digit display (TM1637Display)  
arduino_reciver_0_91oled -> receiving data from another arduino via UART and display them on 0.91" oled display
